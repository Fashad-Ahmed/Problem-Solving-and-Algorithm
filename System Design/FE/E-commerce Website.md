### Frontend Components Overview
The frontend will be built using React to handle the user interface due to its component-based architecture, fast re-rendering with virtual DOM, and compatibility with modern JavaScript tooling. Since the project will be large-scale, modularity, code splitting, state management, and performance are key considerations.

Key Components:
Product Catalog: Displays products, filters, and handles search queries.
Product Detail Page: Rich product information with reviews and availability.
Shopping Cart: Manage items in the cart, apply coupons, and handle user interactions.
Checkout: Payment processing, address management, and form handling.
User Account: Handle user login, profile, and order history.
Real-time Notifications and Updates: Display stock updates and order statuses.
